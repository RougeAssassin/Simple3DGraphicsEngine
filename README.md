# Simple3DGraphicsEngine
The simple 3D graphics engine project is an exercise in understanding modern graphics engines. Though this project focuses on building a 3D graphics engine, the implementation will be quite simple. There are a number of walkthroughs and tutorials available to guide in this project. Another reason for this project is the practical application of vector calculus and linear algebra in a coding project. The simple 3D graphics engine requires math from both fields to work properly which will result in a challenging project. This project is not intended to be incorporated with the game project. The code and details for this project will be available on GitHub as well as on this site (upon completion).
